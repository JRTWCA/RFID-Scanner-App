# RFID-Scanner-App

This application reads in live data from an RFID scanner through a serial port, then sorts and exports the data into a CSV.
This project is part of a year-long research project to test the viability of Aerial RFID scanning in an outdoor environment.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

run the installer.


## Usage

This application is project specific, expecting a very specific communication format from a custom system. You probably won't have a use for it.
